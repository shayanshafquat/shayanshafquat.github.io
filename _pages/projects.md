### NREM sleep in the rodent neocortex and hippocampus reflects excitable dynamics

1. **Neural Dynamics Modeling:** Reimplemented a Wilson-Cowan-like model to simulate and analyze UP/DOWN state dynamics in the neocortex and hippocampus during NREM sleep, revealing distinct excitability regimes.
2. **Bifurcation and Stability Analysis:** Conducted bifurcation analysis and phase plane plotting to categorize neural dynamics into oscillatory, bistable, ExcitableUP, and ExcitableDOWN regimes, highlighting their stability and transition mechanisms.
3. **Quantitative Insights:** Provided quantitative analysis of state duration distributions, demonstrating how neural drive and adaptation influence the stability and dynamics of UP/DOWN states, contributing to a unified understanding of sleep-related brain activity.

### Open source, cross simulator, large scale cortical models in NeuroML  Google Summer of Code 2022 (INCF)

1. Verify, improve and test the original model code in NEURON
2. Convert the published network model involving channels, cells, and connectivity developed in a simulator-specific format to NeuroML
3. Document and illustrate the baseline expected behavior of the model and share them across Open Source Brain repositories

### Reward and punishment-related changes in behavior during a 2AFC task in mice (Neuromatch Academy)

<img style="float: left;" src="/images/rrs.png" width="200" height="200" hspace="30">

1. Used [IBL datasets](data.internationalbrainlab.org) to analyse and model the decision-making (2AFC task) in mice
2. Streak distribution isn't random but rather influenced by task's difficulty, learning and motivation
3. Trained and evaluated a logistic regression model to predict the correctness of the next choice
