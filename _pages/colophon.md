This website is based on A Github Pages template for academic sites. This was forked (then detached) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is © 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License.

I modified a lot of contents according to my taste. I use Sublime Text 3 to edit majority of the content available here. The site is generated using Jekyll, hosted using Github pages and the domain is acquired from GoDaddy.
