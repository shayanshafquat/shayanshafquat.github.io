# Student Organization

___

## [KRSSG](https://krssg.in/index.html)

<img style="float: left;" src="/images/krssg.png" width="200" height="200" hspace="30">

The group consists of a bunch of robotics enthusiasts working on the development of autonomous soccer-playing robots for participation in International Competitions like RoboCup and FIRA. Currently, I am the Student Advisor to the group with a focus on the Embedded Electronics team which is responsible for the design of FPGA based circuits involving communication with the base station and BLDC motor based control unit. During my third year, I led the team at Robocup 2017 at Nagoya, Japan (first Indian team at SSL Robocup).

## Analog PUF

<img style="float: left;" src="/images/puf.png" width="200" height="200" hspace="30">

The project was an extension of my training at VLSI Summer School IIT Kharagpur, guided by [Prof. Mrigank Sharad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrigank-sharad-b2835b7/?originalSubdomain=in), presently at Dep. of Engineering Entrepreneurship IIT Kharagpur prev. Dept of E&ECE, IIT Kharagpur. The aim of the project is to design a low power multi-bit adaptive SRAM topology-based analog PUF which variations generated from the mismatch in the current mirror structures considered as bitcell. The other contributors of the project include Dhruv Thapar and Nikhil Bhelave Dept. of EE, IIT Kharagpur.
